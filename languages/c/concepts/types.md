## Basic Types

In C there are several basic types that come built in for us to use. They are the following:
- int
- char 
- float
- double
These are what could be considered as the foundational types to use to build a program.
Char is an unsigned 8 bit integer that can hold values from 0 to 255. These coincide with ANSI characters.
Int is an integer that changes based on the system but is usually a 32 bit signed integer type. This means that it can hold a range from
(-find value) to (upper).
Float is a precision floating point number that is used when you need more precision with your integers.
Double is ...

### The <stdint.h> header

With the advent of more current versions of C we now have a header that allows us to be more specific with our typings.
